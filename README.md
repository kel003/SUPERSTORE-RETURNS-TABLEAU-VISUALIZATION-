# SUPERSTORE-RETURNS-TABLEAU-VISUALIZATION-
In this project i am trying to discover what is the cause of orders being returned. After discovering the reason we next try come up with solutions to reduces returns for the company.

In my first visual i created a scatterplot showing the correlation between total sales vs total returns by subcategory . I inserted the calculated feild labeled "is returned" on the rows , with the sum of the sales inserted in columns. Now you can compare the amount sales and number of returns in each category. 

Next i created a bar chart to examine the return rate for each category. This time i wanted to see the average so i filtered my calculated feild to the average measure to see the volume of returns each category generates.

A map visual of the united states was created to see the average return rate in each state.

My calclated feild is measured by avarage once again in the next visual. I built a line chart to show the monthly return rate average.

The last 2 slides consists of my dashboard and story. This is used  to explain what results where found in my data on each visual.
